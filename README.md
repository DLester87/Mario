# Mario
This is a one level re-creation of the origional Super Mario Bros.  Imported lwjgl and slick jars from Slick2D software package to make the screen scroll left and right as character ran.  Keeps track of collision detection with enemies, blocks, and holes, has a countdown timer, and keeps score and amount of lives.
